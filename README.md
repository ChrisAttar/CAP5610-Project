# Kepler Exoplanet Search

## Description
This project is based on a dataset found in the Kaggle public dataset tab at [this](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results) location. 
The goal I set for this project was to classify potential exoplanets as CANDIDATE, CONFIRMED, or FALSE POSITIVE using different Machine Learning models.
The dataset was distributed by NASA Exoplanet Archive and is explained [here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_kepcandidate_columns.html)
